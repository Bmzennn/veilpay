name: veilpay
description: Make and receive private payments on Solana via VeilPay. Use when an agent needs to send funds without an on-chain link between sender and recipient, generate shareable payment links, claim incoming payments, perform confidential transfers, or query encrypted balances. Powered by the Umbra ZK shielded pool.

# VeilPay Agent Skill

VeilPay enables fully private payments on Solana. The sender and recipient are never linked on-chain — a Groth16 ZK proof breaks any cryptographic connection between deposit and withdrawal.

## ⚠️ Full Runtime Preparation — Run Before Any Script

Never assume the environment is ready. ZK-SNARK skills have complex peer dependencies, binary requirements, and browser-vs-Node.js conflicts that must be resolved before first execution.

### Phase 1: Dependency Installation

```bash
cd <skill-directory>
rm -rf node_modules          # clean slate avoids partial-install conflicts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

`--legacy-peer-deps` is **required** — the Umbra ZK prover and the Umbra SDK have conflicting peer dependency requirements. Standard `npm install` fails.

**`bs58` is pinned to `4.0.1` — do not upgrade it.** After v4, bs58 changed its export structure from a direct export (`bs58.encode()`) to a default export (`bs58.default.encode()`). Any higher version silently breaks every script with `TypeError: bs58.encode is not a function`.

**`snarkjs` must be present** — it is a silent requirement for local ZK proof generation. It is in `package.json` but easy to miss if you install manually.

### Phase 2: Smoke Test

Verify all three critical runtime dependencies before running any command:

```bash
node -e "require('snarkjs'); require('bs58'); console.log('Runtime Ready')"
```

If this prints `Runtime Ready`, the environment is good. If it throws, run Phase 1 again.

Full smoke test:

```bash
node scripts/wallet.cjs show
```

If this returns an address, everything is working. If it throws `Cannot find module`, re-run Phase 1. If `bs58.encode is not a function`, check the installed version: `node -e "console.log(require('bs58/package.json').version)"` — must be `4.0.1`.

### Phase 3: Legacy Key Detection (Base58 → Base64 Migration)

Old versions of this skill stored secret keys in **base58**. The current scripts read keys as **base64**. `wallet.cjs` auto-detects and migrates old keys when you run `show` or `balance` — but if you see a key-related error in any other script, run this first:

```bash
node scripts/wallet.cjs show   # triggers auto-migration if needed
```

If `wallet.json` was written by an older version, the `secretKey` field will be longer than 88 characters or won't decode cleanly as base64. Running `show` will print `ℹ️ Migrated wallet key format from bs58 → base64` and fix it automatically.

### Phase 4: Known Runtime Conflicts (Browser SDK in Node.js)

The VeilPay SDK was built for browsers. Two conflicts arise in Node.js that the scripts already patch internally:

**1. `file://` URL support** — The ZK prover downloads circuit files to `~/.veilpay/zk-cache/` then fetches them via `file://` paths. Node.js native fetch (Undici) cannot read `file://` URLs. All scripts that generate ZK proofs (`create-link.cjs`, `claim-link.cjs`, `pay-invoice.cjs`) patch `global.fetch` at startup to intercept `file://` calls and serve them from disk.

**2. CDN User-Agent** — CloudFront returns HTTP 403 on headless/bot requests. All download functions inject `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0` into CDN requests.

**These patches are already in the scripts.** If you see HTTP 403 from the CDN or errors about `file://` URLs, the script version is outdated — re-sync from the source repo.

### Flawless Agent Checklist

```
□ Is snarkjs installed?           node -e "require('snarkjs')"
□ Is bs58 version 4.0.1?          node -e "console.log(require('bs58/package.json').version)"
□ Is wallet.json in base64?       node scripts/wallet.cjs show
□ Is SOL balance ≥ 0.05?          node scripts/wallet.cjs balance
□ Are file:// and CDN patches in? Check top of the .cjs script for global.fetch patch
```

### Balance Check Before Link Creation

Always verify the agent has enough SOL before attempting link creation. Creating a private link costs ~0.02 SOL in ephemeral registration fees plus the transfer amount itself.

```bash
node scripts/wallet.cjs balance --network devnet
# Balance must be ≥ 0.02 + transfer amount
```

### Suppress Ed25519 Experimental Warnings

```bash
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 node scripts/create-link.cjs --amount 0.5 --token SOL
```

## ⏱️ Paying x402 Invoices — Timing Is Critical

Shielded x402 payments have three timing constraints that cause failures if ignored.

### The Three Timing Traps

**1. Script hangs after payment** — Fixed in `pay-invoice.cjs`. The Umbra and Solana SDKs hold WebSocket connections open after completing. The script now calls `process.exit(0)` immediately after printing the `AUTHORIZATION` header.

**2. Invoice expiry race condition** — The server issues an invoice, the agent must pay it before it expires (10 minutes on VeilPay's server). The ZK proof generation takes 20–60 seconds. If the agent pauses between fetching the invoice and running `pay-invoice.cjs`, it may expire. **Chain the operations atomically:**

```bash
# Fetch invoice, pay immediately, wait for indexer, retry — all in one shell string
INVOICE=$(curl -s https://www.veilpayments.xyz/api/premium-data | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(json.dumps(d['invoice']))") && \
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 node scripts/pay-invoice.cjs "$INVOICE" --network devnet && \
sleep 15 && \
curl -H "Authorization: x402 <paste_auth_value_here>" https://www.veilpayments.xyz/api/premium-data
```

**3. Indexer lag** — Even after your transaction confirms on Solana, the Umbra indexer takes an additional 10–15 seconds to process the block. The server verifies by querying the indexer. Submit the Authorization header too early and the server returns 403. **Always wait 15 seconds** between `pay-invoice.cjs` completing and the retry request.

### Flawless x402 Execution Order

```
1. node scripts/wallet.cjs balance           ← must be ≥ 0.02 SOL
2. Fetch the 402 endpoint → capture invoice JSON
3. Immediately pipe invoice into pay-invoice.cjs (no pauses)
4. pay-invoice.cjs prints AUTHORIZATION and exits
5. sleep 15                                  ← indexer sync window
6. Retry request with Authorization header
```

### "Invoice unknown or expired" diagnosis

If you see this error, the cause is one of:

| Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase tables missing | Server logs show "Supabase invoice insert failed" | Run the x402 table setup SQL in Supabase |
| Cross-instance serverless | Works locally, fails on Vercel | Tables MUST exist in Supabase — in-memory breaks across instances |
| Indexer lag | Retried too fast after payment | Add `sleep 15` before retry |
| Invoice genuinely expired | More than 10 minutes between fetch and pay | Chain the commands — no intermediate stops |

## 🔄 Updating This Skill

When the user asks to update this skill, follow this protocol exactly. Do not assume the local folder is complete or up to date.

### Step 1 — Find the source repo

Check `skills-lock.json` in the project root for the exact GitHub source:
```bash
cat skills-lock.json | grep veilpay
```
Source: **https://github.com/Bmzennn/agent-skills** — skill folder: `veilpay/`

### Step 2 — Crawl the full remote tree before touching anything locally

Fetch the GitHub tree to see every file in the repo. Do not rely on what you see locally — scripts may have been added, removed, or renamed remotely without being reflected in the local folder.

```
GET https://api.github.com/repos/Bmzennn/agent-skills/git/trees/main?recursive=1
```

Or via web fetch: `https://github.com/Bmzennn/agent-skills/tree/main/veilpay`

Compare remote files against local files. Any file present remotely but missing locally must be downloaded.

### Step 3 — Sync `package.json` and `SKILL.md` first

These two files define requirements and intended behaviour. Always pull them before touching any script:

```bash
# Download package.json first — it pins critical versions
# Then SKILL.md — it tells you what each script is supposed to do
```

**Why this matters:** `bs58` underwent a breaking export change after v4. The `package.json` pins `bs58@4.0.1`. If you install without it, npm defaults to v6 which breaks every script that calls `bs58.encode()` directly with `TypeError: bs58.encode is not a function`.

### Step 4 — Overwrite all scripts at once

Never update scripts one at a time. The scripts share conventions (key encoding, wallet file format, error handling). A partial update creates inconsistencies — for example, `wallet.cjs` stores keys as **base64**, and every other script reads base64. Updating only some scripts breaks the key format contract.

```bash
# Copy all .cjs files from remote in one batch, then reinstall
```

### Step 5 — Clean reinstall with legacy peer deps

```bash
cd <skill-directory>
rm -rf node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Why `--legacy-peer-deps`:** The Umbra ZK prover and Umbra SDK have conflicting peer dependency requirements. Standard `npm install` fails. `--legacy-peer-deps` is required in any generic agent environment.

### Step 6 — Smoke test

```bash
node scripts/wallet.cjs show
```

If this returns an address, the runtime environment is correctly set up. If it throws `Cannot find module`, re-run Step 5. If it throws `TypeError: ... is not a function`, the bs58 pin failed — check that `node_modules/bs58/package.json` shows version `4.0.1`.

### Diagnostic: `TypeError: X is not a function`

This is a **100% signal of a major version mismatch**, not a code bug. Do not rewrite the script. Check the installed version of the failing package first:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('bs58/package.json').version)"
# Must print 4.0.1 — anything higher breaks .encode() calls
```

## Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Private link** | A shareable URL containing an ephemeral claim key. Anyone with the link can claim funds to a fresh wallet. |
| **Confidential transfer** | Direct send to a VeilPay-registered address. Amount is hidden on-chain; sender↔recipient relationship is visible. |
| **Shielded pool** | Umbra's ZK pool where funds wait. An anonymity set of all UTXOs in the pool provides unlinkability. |
| **Ephemeral address** | A one-time keypair used as the anonymizing hop between sender and recipient. |
| **Claim secret** | The private key for the ephemeral address, encoded in the URL hash. Never touches any server. |

---

## When to Use Which Feature

```
Need to send to someone who doesn't have a Solana wallet?
  → Private Link (they claim later, no wallet needed upfront)

Need to send to an existing VeilPay user without revealing amount?
  → Confidential Transfer

Want to check if a payment link has been claimed?
  → Check Link Status

Have an incoming link and want to withdraw funds?
  → Claim Link
```

---

## Script Reference

All scripts require a funded agent wallet. Create one first:

```bash
node scripts/wallet.cjs create           # generate keypair, saved to ~/.veilpay/wallet.json
node scripts/wallet.cjs show             # print public address
node scripts/wallet.cjs balance          # print SOL balance
node scripts/wallet.cjs airdrop          # request devnet SOL (devnet only)
```

---

### 1. Generate a Private Payment Link

Deposits funds into the shielded pool and returns a claim URL. The recipient uses the URL to withdraw to their wallet.

```bash
node scripts/create-link.cjs \
  --amount 0.5 \
  --token SOL \
  --network devnet \
  [--memo "Invoice #42"] \
  [--lock-to <recipient_solana_address>]
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Private link created
Link: https://www.veilpayments.xyz/claim?lid=...&exp=...#<claim_secret>:SOL:<memo>
Amount: 0.5 SOL
Expires: 2026-05-03
Share this link with the recipient. The claim key (after #) is private.
```

**Options:**
- `--amount` — amount to send (required)
- `--token` — SOL or USDC (required)
- `--network` — devnet or mainnet (default: mainnet)
- `--memo` — optional message to recipient, encoded in the link
- `--lock-to` — restrict claiming to a specific wallet address

**Note:** Link creation requires ~0.018 SOL for ephemeral registration fees + the transfer amount. The ephemeral SOL is recovered when the recipient claims.

---

### 2. Claim a Payment Link

Reconstructs the ephemeral keypair from the claim secret, claims the UTXO from the shielded pool, and sweeps funds to the recipient wallet.

```bash
node scripts/claim-link.cjs \
  --link "https://www.veilpayments.xyz/claim?lid=...#<secret>:SOL" \
  --recipient <destination_wallet_address> \
  --network devnet
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Claim successful
Amount: 0.5 SOL
Delivered to: 7xKt...9mPq
Transaction: https://solscan.io/tx/...
```

**Note:** Claiming runs a full Groth16 ZK proof locally — this takes 20–60 seconds. The recipient address does not need to be a VeilPay user.

---

### 3. Confidential Transfer (Direct)

Sends directly to a VeilPay-registered address. Amount is hidden via Arcium MPC; the sender↔recipient link is visible on-chain but the amount is not.

```bash
node scripts/transfer.cjs \
  --to <recipient_veilpay_address> \
  --amount 100 \
  --token USDC \
  --network devnet
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Confidential transfer sent
Recipient: 7xKt...9mPq (registered VeilPay user)
Amount: hidden on-chain
Transaction: https://solscan.io/tx/...
```

**Note:** The recipient must have connected to VeilPay at least once to receive confidential transfers (their Umbra account must be registered).

---

### 4. Check Link Status

Checks whether a payment link has been funded, claimed, or already withdrawn — without needing the recipient's wallet.

```bash
node scripts/check-link.cjs \
  --link "https://www.veilpayments.xyz/claim?lid=...#<secret>:SOL" \
  --network devnet
```

**Output:**
```
Status: pending          # funds in pool, not yet claimed
Status: claimed          # ZK proof accepted, withdrawal in progress
Status: delivered        # funds swept to recipient's wallet
Status: not_found        # link expired or claim key is wrong
```

---

### 5. Query Encrypted Balance

Checks what encrypted balance (received via confidential transfers) is waiting in your VeilPay account.

```bash
node scripts/balance.cjs \
  --network devnet
```

**Output:**
```
Encrypted balances for 7xKt...9mPq:
  SOL:  0.0000
  USDC: 42.00  ← withdraw to claim
```

---

### 6. Withdraw Encrypted Balance

Withdraws your encrypted balance to your public wallet. Supports a single token or `--all` to sweep everything.

```bash
node scripts/withdraw.cjs --token USDC --network devnet
node scripts/withdraw.cjs --all --network devnet
```

---

### 7. Pay an x402 Invoice

When an API responds with HTTP 402 Payment Required, use this to fulfill the invoice with a shielded Umbra deposit and get back the Authorization header value.

```bash
# Capture the invoice from the 402 response body, then:
node scripts/pay-invoice.cjs '{"amount":0.1,"token":"SOL","destination":"3uv9...","invoiceId":"a3f9...64hex"}' \
  --network devnet
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Invoice paid.

AUTHORIZATION: x402 5Kj9...:8Nm2...:a3f9...

Retry your request with:
  -H "Authorization: x402 5Kj9...:8Nm2...:a3f9..."
```

The `invoiceId` must be the exact 64-character hex string from the server's 402 response. The amount is shielded — the server sees a proof, not the raw transfer.

---

## Privacy Model — What This Hides

| What an observer sees | What they cannot see |
|---|---|
| A deposit entered the shielded pool | Which wallet deposited |
| An ephemeral address claimed from the pool | That the deposit and claim are the same payment |
| Funds arrived at the recipient's wallet | Who sent them |
| A confidential transfer occurred | The amount transferred |

**Residual risk:** Timing and amount correlation. If you deposit 1.5 SOL and the claim happens 2 minutes later for the same amount, a sophisticated analyst may guess. Longer delay = stronger anonymity set.

---

## Environment Variables

```bash
VEILPAY_NETWORK=devnet          # devnet or mainnet
VEILPAY_RPC_URL=https://...     # optional custom RPC (default: public devnet)
VEILPAY_WALLET_PATH=~/.veilpay/wallet.json  # default wallet location
```
